# OBSOLETE - How to enable delayed loading of images in Entity Framework 6

>**NOTE**: We encourage our Entity Framework 6 (EF 6) users to consider Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for new XAF's Blazor and WinForms .NET Core projects.
Microsoft has moved EF 6 into maintenance mode, and as such, EF 6 will not mirror XAFâ€™s .NET 5+ offering. At present, EF Core supports key XAF technologies/capabilities including advanced security and comprehensive audit trail support. EF Core also offers better performance when compared to EF 6. For more information, see [Porting from EF 6 to EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/efcore-and-ef6/porting/) | [XAF Business Model Design with Entity Framework Core](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/401886/business-model-design-orm/business-model-design-with-entity-framework-core).

<p>When a EF6 application displays a lot of large images in a List View, it mayÂ consumeÂ a lot of memory. It is most actual for ASP.NET applications with many simultaneously connected clients. This example describes how to enable delayed (orÂ <em>lazy</em>) loading of images to reduce the memory usage.<br /><br /><strong>Entity Framework</strong>Â supportsÂ <em>lazy loadingÂ </em>for referencedÂ entities, not for simple properties. Thus, you need to declare a newÂ <strong>DelayedImage</strong>Â entity exposing the ImageData property of a byte array typeÂ for storing images. Then, you can declare a reference property of theÂ <strong>DelayedImageÂ </strong>type where required (in this example, such a property is declared in theÂ <strong>SampleObjectÂ </strong>class).Â </p>
<p>It is necessary to set theÂ <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.EF.Utils.DelayedAttribute?v=19.1">DevExpress.ExpressApp.EF.Utils.Delayed</a><strong>Â </strong>attribute both to the reference propertyÂ and the image storage property. Also you need to applyÂ the <a href="http://help.devexpress.com/#Xaf/DevExpressPersistentBaseExpandObjectMembersEnumtopic">ExpandObjectMembers</a><strong>Â </strong>attribute to the reference property to make the image visible.</p>
